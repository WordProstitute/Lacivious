Voice through screen door ,,Fes, is that you?''

,,Yes, mom. It is Fes,'' fans palm, fights breeze ''Where is Mary?''

,,I know not.''

Fes sits upon step, leans upon rail, rests elbow upon joint, picks at grass ,,Is Mary out?''

,,I know not. Mary's luggage is here.''

,,What time will Mary-''

,,Arrive? I know not. But Mary's luggage is here.''

A cough.

Ashes descend. 

Paint chips in the stead of petals (the thorns are still rooted).

<i>Base of Sun dips into horizon upon the Ocean of Fire</i>. 

Fes wipes neck and leans back, elbows upon stoop ,,I shall remain on porch. If you need anything please hesitate not to request.''

Fes pulls pack upon waist, shakes ||head|| <NO> (side to side), whispers ''<i>Where is the mother</i>.''

Mom clears throat, fans palm from couch ,,Was working late...made some break through...needed a statement for the index of the journal.''

,,Invented coal for the abyss?''

,,Yes...''

<i>Now.</i>

Beg for forgiveness<i>.</i>

Fes opens pack. Digits dip in, grab flint and steel. Strike. Spark. Ignition. Smoke. Pops of cherry glow during the dusk. Fes visors sight. 

The Glare. The Reflection.

Mind hones upon the exhale.

Mind...<i>drifts</i>...

Shadows Play: <i>Pop It In Across Gravel Way</i>.
