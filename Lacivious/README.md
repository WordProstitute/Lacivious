## Published: 

Lacivious was publish by Word Prostitute&reg; in 2003.

## Description:

Lacivious is Foreplay of Lassivyous that is sex of Lascivious which is life.

As Foreplay, it will flirt and it may turn you off or may turn you on as it was written by a naive writer eager to pleasure self more than the reader and wanted to write the coming of music from sound to words and needed three acts for it to come. The naive writer also needed time and experience to become a writer to complete the story beyond foreplay.

## Open Source Disclaimer:

Lacivious's pages for this open source release originated from a Portable Document Format file exported to Hyper Text Mark-up Language file then formatted in a text document marked with Word Prostitute&reg; Mark-up Language. 

It should be noted that space and likely some meta information like font color or italics are missing from the open source version due to the multiple extraction steps. 

If a naive publisher would have used Word Prostitute&reg;'s System of Record for Fiction instead of Adobe's Indesign as the story's system of record then this open source version of Lacivious would be equal to the paper release.

## Use Case

Word Prostitute&reg; is currently using Lacivious as the end goal for its machine learning tools to learn.

## TODO

1. Verify dtd. 
2. Compare paper version with electric version.
3. Understand space.
4. Process with wordcheck and write a feature to recognize and value space.
